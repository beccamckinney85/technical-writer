# This is my technical writing portfolio site.

<p>My name is Becca and I've been a technical writer for 7+ years. I hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Technical Communication with a concentration in data analysis and presentation.  
  
I mostly work in the SaaS space, making complex information easy to understand. I create user-centric help guides, configuration docs, release notes, video tutorials, and other resources.
